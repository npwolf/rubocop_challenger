# Rubocop Challenger

If you introduce [`rubocop`](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) to an existing Rails project later, you will use [`$ rubocop --auto-gen-config`](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/manual/configuration.md#automatically-generated-configuration). But it will make a huge `.rubocop_todo.yml` and make you despair.
On the other hand, `rubocop` has [`--auto-correct`](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/manual/basic_usage.md#other-useful-command-line-flags) option, it is possible to automatically repair the writing which does not conform to the rule. But since it occasionally destroys your code, it is quite dangerous to apply all at once.
It is ideal that to remove a disabled rule from `.rubocop_todo.yml` every day, to check whether it passes test, and can be obtained consent from the team. But it requires strong persistence and time.
I call such work *Rubocop Challenge*. And the *RubocopChallenger* is a gem to support this challenge!

## Rubocop Challenge Flow

1. Run *RubocopChallenger* periodically from CI tool etc.
1. When *RubocopChallenger* starts, delete a disabled rule from `.rubocop_todo.yml` existing in your project, execute `$ rubocop --auto-correct` and create a PR which include modified results
1. You confirm the PR passes testing and then merge it if there is no problem

## Usage

GitHub personal access token is required for sending pull requests to your repository.

1. Go to [your account's settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and [generate a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with "repo" scope
